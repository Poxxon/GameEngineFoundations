# WindowEngine — Assignment 2

### Library Used
This project uses **OpenTK** (Open Toolkit) for window creation, OpenGL rendering, and input.

### How to Run
- Make sure you have **.NET 8 SDK** installed
- Clone this repo and open the project folder
- Run:
  ```bash
  dotnet run
  ```

### Controls
- **ESC** → quit the app  
- **F1** → toggle wireframe / filled mode  

### Notes
I implemented this on macOS using Visual Studio Code with the .NET 8 SDK, since I couldn’t get Visual Studio Community on Windows working.
